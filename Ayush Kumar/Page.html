 <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
 </center>
 <p>A buzzing word nowadays! <br>
 Anytime we see a computer do something that appears to be intelligent or rational in some
 way, like recognizing someone's face in a photo, or being able to play a game better than
 people can, or being able to understand human language when we talk to our phones and
 they understand what we mean and are able to respond back to us (like in siri, alexa, virtual
 assistance), Google predictive search engine, spam mail detection in gmail - all are examples
 of AI, or artificial intelligence. <br>
 This Artificial Intelligence is nothing but it composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence,
 where Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI
 means "a man-made thinking power." <br>
 AI is sort of a process or it's a methodology which enables machine to mimic human
 behaviour. The goal behind AI is to make intelligent machines that can behave like a human,
 think like humans, and able to analyse and make decisions on its own."</p>
